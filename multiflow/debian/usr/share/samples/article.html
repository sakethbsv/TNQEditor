<p class="abstractpara"> Nobel laureates Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley
<i>came</i> up <b>with</b> a model to calculate the power behind electrochemical
currents in neurons—a great step forward in understanding how the brain
worked and how it divvied up resources. The only problem was that their
subject was not a person, or even a rodent, but a giant squid. Today,
researchers announced that they have found a more accurate model for
mammal brains, which elevates some of their transactions to three times
more efficient than that of the squid-based equations.</p>
<br><p>
To carry information, chemical signals fire across&nbsp; trillions of brain-cell <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=glia-cells-help-neurons-b">synapses</a> (connections between neurons). <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=interview-with-roderick-m">The Hodgkin–Huxley model</a>
proposed a 50–50 energy use split for the two key axon processes (the
action potential, wherein ions establish an electrochemical charge
difference across the synapse, smoothing the way for chemical signals;
and the postsynaptic potential, the restoration of the electrical state
after a chemical signal is sent).</p>
<br><p>
The new work, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/">reported online today in <em>Science</em></a>,
proposes that in mammalian brains, the split is actually closer to 15
percent for spikes (action potentials) and 85 percent for the
subsequent synapse change. Although the total energy usage appears to
be the same, the division may have important implications in the
understanding of <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=refueling-the-brain">how modern brains developed</a>. </p>
<br><div class="textbox">
How are mammals able to save so much energy on the front end? Hodgkin
and Huxley's squid brain fired more ions that overlapped, requiring
more energy to reestablish an electrochemical differential. <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/topic.cfm?id=mammals">Mammals</a>'
brains, however, appear to space out the movement of the ions, lowering
the amount of charge differential restorations needed after the action.
"The less charges you move across, the less energy you have to use to
reestablish the gradient," says <a href="http://bmi.epfl.ch/page61215.html">Pierre Magistretti</a>,
director of the School of Life Sciences—Brain Mind Institute at the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, who wrote an
accompanying perspectives article in <em>Science</em>.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div class="textbox">
Scientists who study the brain often depend on energy budgets to
estimate allocations of where energy is input and consumed. "It's hard
to come up with the numbers for these budgets," says <a href="http://frontiersin.org/neuroscience/profiles/arndroth/">Arnd Roth</a>,
a study author and senior researcher at University College London's
Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research. "It's not their fault," he
says of researchers who have been working under now-disproved
assumptions.</div>
<br><p class="Paragraph">
The findings may put to rest the "long-lasting debate about which one
of these processes costs the most energy," Magistretti says. There
might, however, still be some doubters: The new study was performed on
rats, but Roth is reasonably confident that the results would be
similar for humans. "We have now another model" to replace the
half-a-century-old Hodgkin–Huxley equations, he says, adding, in rats'
axons, "shape is similar; the same molecules are involved, so that
should suggest that they should behave similarly" in people. Roth and
his team's tests were limited to axons in the hippocampus, and he notes
that axons elsewhere in the rats should be tested to ensure that energy
usage is standard across the brain.</p>
<br><p class="Paragraph">
Just how the new ratio will affect analysis of brain images also
remains debatable. As Magistretti notes, "All the functional brain
imaging techniques that are used to explore brain activity, <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-new-phrenology">fMRI</a>
or PET (positron emission tomography), measure the use of energy in
areas that are more active than others." But those types of imaging
measure this sort of energy use only indirectly, so, Roth says, "It's
up to the fMRI people to take this on board and decide what it means to
the signals they are seeing."</p>
<br><p class="Paragraph">
That there is (Smith, 1999) such a y vast difference (Schwartz, 1999) in efficiency between giant squid
and small rats raises some big [12,15,20,50,14] questions for Roth and others interested
in how the brain evolved. "It's a curious fact that in the squid
[energy use] appears to not be optimal," he says. The difference [13-14] may
be, he speculates, that the squid depends more on its <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=two-neurons-meet">neurons</a>
to communicate rapid actions for escape, thereby sacrificing energy
efficiency for speed. A bias toward Vander Waal (1984) efficiency might, in turn, have
allowed mammals Simon and Venkat (2000) to evolve to be brainier—if possibly slower to respond.</p>
<br><p class="Paragraph">
Such a proposition raises other questions: What is the optimal
efficiency rate? What are some of the other trade-offs, like
reliability?</p>
<br><p class="Paragraph">
Ultimately, it seems odd to Roth that such a large error should
continue to persist for years after testing was possible. But the
efficiency figure was so well accepted that it has just "been in the
back of people's heads—not at the front," he says. No one had taken the
time to investigate: "Does it have to be like that? Is it a law of
nature?"</p>
