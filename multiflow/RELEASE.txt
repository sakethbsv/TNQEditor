We have two release files:

1) multiflow.deb
2) multiflow.xpi

both are zip files.

You can also use the XPI to create a standalone:

a) unzip multiflow.xpi to "multiflow" folder
b) uncomment the line
/*pref("toolkit.defaultChromeURI", "chrome://multiflow/content/editor.xul");*/
i.e.. make it
pref("toolkit.defaultChromeURI", "chrome://multiflow/content/editor.xul");

c) install xulrunner
d) now you can run multiflow as:
   xulrunner multiflow/application.ini
e) "xulrunner" can also be replaced by "firefox -app" if you have Firefox 3.0+
f) you can also put this in a shell file and create a soft link, in fact if you unzip multiflow.deb file you can recover the /usr/bin/multiflow shell file
g) Abiword and LaTeXML are required to do convertions from Word and LaTeX documents, respectively.

(you can add -jsconsole option [this will fire-up a error console] if you like to debug)

------------------------------
Debug mode
------------------------------
In the "defaults/preferences/prefs.js" file
debug mode has been switched on to flag in Error Console.
This might affect performance, so can be switched-off for normal users.

Known Bugs for Firefox addon:
------------------------------

It has not been easy to switch language,
however, in Firefox

using the url: "about:config"
intl.locale.matchOS to "false"
general.useragent.locale to "*"
where "*" could be "ta-TA" if you are Tamil,
and "*" could be "de-DE" if you are German (Deutsh).

seems to work.

-----------------------------
Known issues in Debian (Lenny)
-----------------------------
In Debian-Lenny-IceWeasel the Addon seems to work but switching language has not been easy in  Debian, either in the addon or the standalone.
