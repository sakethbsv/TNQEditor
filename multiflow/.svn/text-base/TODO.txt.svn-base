(i) A simple implementation of ChemML using SVG

(ii) Semanic markup capabilties using a system of ID-based micro-format that can display as graphs


Known Bugs
----------

(i) URL escaping and URL->File-path conversions needs professional attention

(ii) UTN28 to MathML conversion code is still raw, so expect problems 

(iii) Detecting file type uses file extensions..blistering barnacles..
